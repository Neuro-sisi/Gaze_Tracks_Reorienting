In this project, we use eye-tracking and EEG techniques to track how attention is deployed in working memory when facing both expected and unexpected events. The code is linked to our preprint published in eLife: 'Re-focusing Visual Working Memory During Expected and Unexpected Memory Tests.' https://elifesciences.org/reviewed-preprints/100532
